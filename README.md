# The-five-pirates
Five pirates have 100 gold coins to divide among themselves. The pirates have a hierarchy, and each pirate will get a chance to propose a distribution plan. If more than half of the pirates agree to the plan, it will be executed. If not, the proposing pirate will be thrown overboard, and the next pirate in the hierarchy will propose a new plan. The pirates are all intelligent and ruthless. How can the captain propose a plan to get the maximum possible gold coins and survive?

Solution 2: The captain, being the smartest, can propose the following distribution plan:
He keeps 99 gold coins for himself and offers 1 coin to the fifth pirate.
If he proposes this plan, here's what will happen:

The fifth pirate will get 1 coin and vote "yes" because he'll be better off than getting nothing.
The fourth pirate will get 99 coins and vote "yes" because he doesn't want to get thrown overboard, and he'll have the majority vote.
The third pirate will get nothing and will vote "no" because he can get a better deal by throwing the captain overboard in the next round.
The second pirate will get nothing and will vote "no" for the same reason.
The first pirate (the captain) will get 99 coins, and the plan will be executed since three pirates vote "yes."
In the end, the captain gets 99 coins, which is the maximum possible for him, and he survives.
